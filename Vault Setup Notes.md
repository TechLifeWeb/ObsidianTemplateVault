# Getting Started
I consistently organize my vaults in a standard manner. I store this file at the root level of my folder structure for quick and easy access. Whenever I add or modify a plugin, I update the notes in this document accordingly. Some changes are straightforward, while others are more complex, so maintaining a record ensures clear documentation for future reference.

## Initial Vault Setup
- Open Settings
	- Editor Tab
		- Turn off Readable Line Length
	- Files and Link Tab

	- Appearance Tab
